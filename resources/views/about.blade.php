                This page was created by the Droid Builder Web Team for the MrBaddeleyPrintedDroid group in the hopes it will become a useful tool for builders in keeping track of their builds and progress.
                <br><br>
                In  the early days, builders would be writing the required parts on notepads and typing them up in a spreadsheet and then marking them completed. Many builders still do this which is perfectly fine! The intention of the Printed Parts Checklist is to be another tool in a Builders Toolbox. Checklists for Michael’s droids are automatically generated for you and all you need to do is tick the boxes for the parts you have printed.
                <br><br>
                The application will keep track of your progress for you as well as keep track of how many parts you have printed. Michael and the community are very thorough and love to help as much as possible. That means that, occasionally, there will be a few different versions for the same part to make sure as many people as possible can print the files. You don’t need to print parts you’re not using in order to reach 100% competition, instead you can simply tick the N/A box to exclude it.
                <br><br>
                The Printed Parts Checklist has many features at the launch which we hope will help builders become more organised and avoid printing duplicates / missing files completely during their build but the work must still come from you!
                <br><br>
                We have many more features that will be added in future updates and we welcome any suggestions. You can suggest any features via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DroidBuilderWebTeam">Facebook Page</a> or by emailing us. See the Contact Page for various ways to get in touch.
